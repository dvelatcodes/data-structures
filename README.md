# data-structures
This is brief my jottings on data structure

## Terminologies
### Data Structure
- This is a pattern or way of organizing and storing data in a storage system or computer memory for easy access or manipulation
### Array
- This is a data structure that allows for access to its elements through its index
### Linked List
- This is a data structure in which its elements also known as nodes contain a value or reference to the next node/element in sequence. The drawback to this is traversing through the list sequentially to the point of interest.
